    <p class="about_text">This website was a collaboration between me and my close friend, Alex. He handled much of the technical 
        programming of the website, and I took care of the aesthetics and of 
        course the actual portfolio. Online he goes by the name "Zifyl", 
        and you may see content in my portfolio where that name is shown.</p>

    <p class="oneabt_text"> 
        As mentioned, my name is Boris. I'm 13 as of writing, and I've attended several different art classes. 
        I've taken part in several soccer teams, 
        and I have been drawing since 1st or 2nd grade. 
        Also at the time of writing, I had only recently begun 
        learning and actively making these renders, using a free software called Blender, which has 3d Modeling, animating, 
        and everything else related to graphic design. I hope to work in game design, alongside my friend Alex. 
        He would be handling the programming side while I would work on character design, animations, the world, etc... similar to how this website went. </p>
